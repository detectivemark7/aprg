### Welcome to APRG!

As for the goal of this project, it's pretty straightforward: There is **NO** goal!

I'm an engineer who finds joy in crafting elegant solutions using clever abstractions.

Simplicity is my mantra, and I strive to create code that is both easy to understand and efficient.

In this project, there are no rigid rules or strict restrictions â€“ it's all about having a good time while coding!

// Static local variables

// Variables declared at block scope with the specifier static or thread_local (since C++11) have static or thread
// (since C++11) storage duration but are initialized the first time control passes through their declaration (unless
// their initialization is zero- or constant-initialization, which can be performed before the block is first entered).
// On all further calls, the declaration is skipped.

// If the initialization throws an exception, the variable is not considered to be initialized,
// and initialization will be attempted again the next time control passes through the declaration.

// If the initialization recursively enters the block in which the variable is being initialized, the behavior is
// undefined.

// If multiple threads attempt to initialize the same static local variable concurrently,
// the initialization occurs exactly once (similar behavior can be obtained for arbitrary functions with
// std::call_once).

// Note: usual implementations of this feature use variants of the double-checked locking pattern,
// which reduces runtime overhead for already-initialized local statics to a single non-atomic boolean comparison.
// (since C++11)

// The destructor for a block-scope static variable is called at program exit, but only if the initialization took place
// successfully.

// Function-local static objects in all definitions of the same inline function (which may be implicitly inline)
// all refer to the same object defined in one translation unit, as long as the function has external linkage.

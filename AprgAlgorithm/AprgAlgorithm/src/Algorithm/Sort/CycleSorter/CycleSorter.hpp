// Cycle sort is an in-place sorting Algorithm, unstable sorting algorithm,
// a comparison sort that is theoretically optimal in terms of the total number of writes to the original array.

// It is optimal in terms of number of memory writes.
// It minimizes the number of memory writes to sort (Each value is either written zero times,
// if it’s already in its correct position, or written one time to its correct position.)
// It is based on the idea that array to be sorted can be divided into cycles.
// We have n nodes and an edge directed from node i to node j if the element at i-th index must be present at j-th index in the sorted array.

// We one by one consider all cycles.
// We first consider the cycle that includes first element.
// We find correct position of first element, place it at its correct position, say j.
// We consider old value of arr[j] and find its correct position,
// we keep doing this till all elements of current cycle are placed at correct position, i.e., we don’t come back to cycle starting point.

// Explanation :
// arr[] = {10, 5, 2, 3}
// index =  0   1   2   3
// cycle_start = 0
// item = 10 = arr[0]

// Find position where we put the item
// pos = cycle_start
// i=pos+1
// while(i<n)
// if (arr[i] < item)
//    pos++;

// We put 10 at arr[3] and change item to old value of arr[3].
// arr[] = {10, 5, 2, 10}
// item = 3

// Again rotate rest cycle that start with index '0'
// Find position where we put the item = 3
// we swap item with element at arr[1] now
// arr[] = {10, 3, 2, 10}
// item = 5

// Again rotate rest cycle that start with index '0' and item = 5
// we swap item with element at arr[2].
// arr[] = {10, 3, 5, 10 }
// item = 2

// Again rotate rest cycle that start with index '0' and item = 2
// arr[] = {2, 3,  5, 10}

// Above is one iteration for cycle_stat = 0.
// Repeat above steps for cycle_start = 1, 2, ..n-2

// Time Complexity : O(n2)
// Worst Case : O(n2)
// Average Case: O(n2)
// Best Case : O(n2)
// This sorting algorithm is best suited for situations where memory write or swap operations are costly.



// Which sorting algorithm makes minimum number of memory writes?

// Minimizing the number of writes is useful when making writes to some huge data set is very expensive,
// such as with EEPROMs or Flash memory, where each write reduces the lifespan of the memory.
// Among the sorting algorithms that we generally study in our data structure and algorithm courses,
// Selection Sort makes least number of writes (it makes O(n) swaps).
// But, Cycle Sort almost always makes less number of writes compared to Selection Sort.
// In Cycle Sort, each value is either written zero times, if it’s already in its correct position, or written one time to its correct position.
// This matches the minimal number of overwrites required for a completed in-place sort.


// Selection sort vs Cycle sort

// Cycle sort has less writes compared to selection sort because it only writes one value in the container
// (the previous value is saved on separate variable) per iteration.
// -> This is less compared to selection sort which swaps the two values per iteration (which have two writes in the container).

// The motivation of this algorithm is to handle items with duplicate keys more efficiently. (compared to original quick sort algorithm)
// Put the equal items in place and focus(sort/partition) on items that are not equal.
// This version of quicksort is still NOT STABLE.

// This algorithm runs by dividing the partition into 3 parts:
// 1) Values less than the partition value is on the left
// 2) Values greater than the partition value is on the right
// 3) Values equal to the partition value is between (1) and (2)

// This is proposed by Djisktra and he was interested in the correctness of programs.

// Worst case (Lower bound): When the keys are distinct so no need to divide the partition into 3 parts.
// What is interesting about this algorithm is that the number compares its using is equal to the lower bound within a constant factor.
// Proof: provided by Sedgewick-Bentley in 1997

// Bottom line is that randomized quicksort with 3-way partitioning reduces running time from linearithmic to linear in broad class of applications.

// Engineering a sort function -> paper by Jon L Bentley and M Douglass Mcllroy
// -> Cut off to insertion sort for small subarrays
// -> Partitioning scheme: 3-way partitioning (like Dijkstra)
// -> Partitioning item:
// ---> small arrays: middle entry
// ---> medium arrays: median of 3
// ---> large arrays: Tukey's ninther
// ------> Pick 9 items in the array (evenly spaced), get median of each 3 samples, get the median of that -> that is Tukey's ninther
// ---> Why Tukey's ninther? Inexpensive and gets close to the middle
// -> No random shuffle, so there is no change is the state of the system and less costly
// -> Now widely used: C C++ Java
// -> Solid right? NO! A killer input exists that causes a stack overflow and crashes the program and would take quadratic if if didnt crash.
// ---> This is because there is no shuffling done.

// Quick selection in worst-case linear time
// Source: http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~csli/graduate/algorithms/book6/chap10.htm

// We now examine a selection algorithm whose running time is O(n) in the worst case.
// Like RANDOMIZED-SELECT, the algorithm SELECT finds the desired element by recursively partitioning the input array.
// The idea behind the algorithm, however, is to guarantee a good split when the array is partitioned.
// SELECT uses the deterministic partitioning algorithm PARTITION from quicksort, modified to take the element to partition around as an input parameter.

// The SELECT algorithm determines the ith smallest of an input array of n elements by executing the following steps:
// 1. Divide the n elements of the input array into n/5 groups of 5 elements each and at most one group made up of the remaining n mod 5 elements.
// 2. Find the median of each of the n/5 groups by insertion sorting the elements of each group (of which there are 5 at most) and taking its middle element.
// -> (If the group has an even number of elements, take the larger of the two medians.)
// 3. Use SELECT recursively to find the median x of the n/5 medians found in step 2.
// 4. Partition the input array around the median-of-medians x using a modified version of PARTITION.
// -> Let k be the number of elements on the low side of the partition, so that n - k is the number of elements on the high side.
// 5. Use SELECT recursively to find the ith smallest element on the low side if i k, or the (i - k)th smallest element on the high side if i > k.

// To analyze the running time of SELECT, we first determine a lower bound on the number of elements that are greater than the partitioning element x.
// At least half of the medians found in step 2 are greater than or equal to the median-of-medians x.
// Thus, at least half of the n/5 groups contribute 3 elements that are greater than x, except for the one group that has fewer than 5 elements
// if 5 does not divide n exactly, and the one group containing x itself.
// Discounting these two groups, it follows that the number of elements greater than x is at least 3n/10 - 6.
// -> 3(ceil(1/2*n/5)-2) >= 3n/10 - 6

// Similarly, the number of elements that are less than x is at least 3n/10 - 6.
// Thus, in the worst case, SELECT is called recursively on at most 7n/10 + 6 elements in step 5.

// We can now develop a recurrence for the worst-case running time T(n) of the algorithm SELECT.
// Steps 1, 2, and 4 take O(n) time.
// Step 2 consists of O(n) calls of insertion sort on sets of size O(1).
// Step 3 takes time T(n/5), and step 5 takes time at most T(7n / 10 + 6), assuming that T is monotonically increasing.
// Note that 7n / 10 + 6 < n for n > 20 and that any input of 80 or fewer elements requires O(1) time.
// We can therefore obtain the recurrence:
// T(n) <= sigma(1)                        if n<=80
//      <= T(n/5) + T(7*n/10 + 6) + O(n)   if n>80

//  We show that the running time is linear by substitution.
// Assume that T(n) cn for some constant c and all n<=80.
// Substituting this inductive hypothesis into the right-hand side of the recurrence yields:
// T(n) <= c(n/5) + c(7n/10 + 6) + O(n)
//      <= cn/5 + c + 7cn/10 + 6c + O(n)
//      <= 9cn/10 + 7c + O(n)
//      <= cn
// since we can pick c large enough so that c(n / 10 - 7) is larger than the function described by the O(n) term for all n > 80.
// The worst-case running time of SELECT is therefore linear.

// As in a comparison sort, SELECT and RANDOMIZED-SELECT determine information about the relative order of elements only by comparing elements.
// Thus, the linear-time behavior is not a result of assumptions about the input, as was the case for the sorting algorithms.
// Sorting requires (n 1g n) time in the comparison model, even on average (see Problem 9-1),
// and thus the method of sorting and indexing presented in the introduction to this chapter is asymptotically inefficient.

// Note that the above algorithm is linear in worst case, but the constants are very high for this algorithm.
// Therefore, this algorithm doesnâ€™t work well in practical situations, randomized quickSelect works much better and preferred.

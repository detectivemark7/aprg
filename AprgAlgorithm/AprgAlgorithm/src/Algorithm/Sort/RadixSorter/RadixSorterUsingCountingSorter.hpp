// The lower bound for Comparison based sorting algorithm (Merge Sort, Heap Sort, Quick-Sort .. etc) is Ω(nLogn), i.e.,
// they cannot do better than nLogn. Counting sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that sort in O(n+k) time when
// elements are in the range from 1 to k.

// What if the elements are in the range from 1 to n2?
// We can’t use counting sort because counting sort will take O(n2) which is worse than comparison-based sorting
// algorithms. Can we sort such an array in linear time? Radix Sort is the answer. The idea of Radix Sort is to do digit
// by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit. Radix sort uses counting sort as a
// subroutine to sort.

// The Radix Sort Algorithm
// -> Do following for each digit i where i varies from least significant digit to the most significant digit.
// ---> Sort input array using counting sort (or any stable sort) according to the i’th digit.

// Example:
// Original, unsorted list: 170, 45, 75, 90, 802, 24, 2, 66

// Sorting by least significant digit (1s place) gives:
// [*Notice that we keep 802 before 2, because 802 occurred before 2 in the original list, and similarly for pairs 170 &
// 90 and 45 and 75.] 170, 90, 802, 2, 24, 45, 75, 66

// Sorting by next digit (10s place) gives:
// [*Notice that 802 again comes before 2 as 802 comes before 2 in the previous list.]
// 802, 2, 24, 45, 66, 170, 75, 90

// Sorting by the most significant digit (100s place) gives:
// 2, 24, 45, 66, 75, 90, 170, 802

// What is the running time of Radix Sort?
// -> Radix Sort takes O(("size of input" + "number of digit values") * "number of digits")
// ---> Or it can be expressed as O((n+b)*d)
// -> Let the "size of input" be "n".
// -> Let the "maximum possible value" be "k".
// ---> In a 32-bit integer its 0xFFFFFFFF or 4294967295.
// -> Let the "number of digit values" be "b".
// ---> The "number of digit values" is also the BASE for digit value.
// -----> For example, in the decimal system the "number of digit values" is 10.
// -----> For example, in the hexadecimal system the "number of digit values" is 16.
// -> Let the "number of digits" be "d".
// ---> The "number of digits" is also equal to O(log"number of digit values"("maximum possible value")).
// So overall time complexity is O(("size of input"+"number of digit values") * log"number of digit values"("maximum
// possible value")).
// -> Or it can be expressed as O((n+b) * logb(k))

// The time complexity for a large k ("maximum possible value"), would be similar to comparison-based sorting
// algorithms. Let us first limit k. Let k <= nc where c is a constant. In that case, the complexity becomes
// O(nLogb(n)). So its still doesn’t beat comparison-based sorting algorithms.

// What if we make the value of b ("number of digit values") larger?
// What should be the value of b to make the time complexity linear?
// If we set b as scalable with n, we get the time complexity as O(n).
// -> So its linear/O(n) if the "number of digit values" is scalable with the "size of input".
// In other words, we can sort an array of integers with a range from 1 to nc if the numbers are represented in base n
// (or every digit takes log2(n) bits).
// -> So if there are 16 numbers (with range 1 to 16c), its better to have base 16 (where every digit is four bits).
// -> So if there are 100 numbers (with range 1 to 100c), its better to have base 64 (where every digit is six bits).
// -> So if there are 1000000 numbers (with range 1 to 1000000c), its better to have base 1048576 (where every digit is
// 20 bits).
// -> Interview question: Sort a million 32-bit integers?
// ---> Radix sort is better because of fixed width.
// ---> For each digit, we can use 20 bits (or 16 bits which is more practical).
// -----> If we use 16 bits: O((n+b) * logb(k)) = 1000000+65536 * log65536(2^32) = 1065536 * 2 = 2131072
// -----> In comparison for a comparison based algorithm: O(n*lg(n)) = 1000000*lg(1000000) = 1000000*19.931568.... =
// 19931568.
// -----> So Radix sort is better.

// Applications of Radix Sort :
// -> In a typical computer, which is a sequential random-access machine, where the records are keyed by multiple fields
// radix sort is used.
// ---> For eg., you want to sort on three keys month, day and year.
// ---> You could compare two records on year, then on a tie on month and finally on the date.
// ---> Alternatively, sorting the data three times using Radix sort first on the date, then on month, and finally on
// year could be used.
// -> It was used in card sorting machines that had 80 columns, and in each column, the machine could punch a hole only
// in 12 places.
// ---> The sorter was then programmed to sort the cards, depending upon which place the card had been punched.
// ---> This was then used by the operator to collect the cards which had the 1st row punched, followed by the 2nd row,
// and so on.

// Is Radix Sort preferable to Comparison based sorting algorithms like Quick-Sort?
// -> If we have log2n bits for every digit, the running time of Radix appears to be better than Quick Sort for a wide
// range of input numbers.
// ---> The constant factors hidden in asymptotic notation are higher for Radix Sort and Quick-Sort uses hardware caches
// more effectively.
// ---> Also, Radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine and counting sort takes extra space to sort numbers.

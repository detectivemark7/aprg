// Algorithm in short terms: Relax all nodes.


// Negative weights failed attempts:
// -> Dijkstra does not work on negative edge weights
// -> Reweighting (adding a constant to make all weights positive) does not work either.

// Proposition: A SPT (shortest path tree) exists iff no negative cycles.
// Proposition: A LPT (longest path tree) exists iff no positive cycles.

// Bellman Ford algorithm: Works on negative weights
// Process:
// "s" is the starting vertex
// 1) Initialize distTo[s]=0 and distTo[v]=infinity for all other vertices
// 2) Repeat V times: Relax each edge.

// Proposition: Dynamic programming algorithm computes SPT in any edge weight digraph with no negative cycles in time proportional to E*V
// Proof idea: After pass i, it found the shortest path containing at most i edges.

// Observation: If distTo[v] does not change during pass i, no need to relax any edge pointing from v in pass i+1
// -> Use a queue! Maintain a queue of vertices whose distTo are changed.

// Overall effect:
// -> running time is still proportional to E*V in worst case.
// -> But much faster than that in practice.

// Observation: If there is a negative cycle, Bellman-Ford gets stuck in a loop, updating distTo and edgeTo entries in the cycle.
// Proposition: If any vertex V is updated in phase V there exists a negative cycle (and can be traced back edgeTo[v] entries to find it)
// We can just check if there are any cycles when relax happened V times. This is implemented above.


// Other discusssions:

// Bellman–Ford Algorithm
// Given a graph and a source vertex src in graph, find shortest paths from src to all vertices in the given graph.
// The graph may contain negative weight edges.
// We have discussed Dijkstra’s algorithm for this problem.
// Dijkstra’s algorithm is a Greedy algorithm and time complexity is O(V+E LogV) (with the use of Fibonacci heap).
// Dijkstra doesn’t work for Graphs with negative weight edges, Bellman-Ford works for such graphs.
// Bellman-Ford is also simpler than Dijkstra and suites well for distributed systems.
// But time complexity of Bellman-Ford is O(VE), which is more than Dijkstra.

// Algorithm
// Following are the detailed steps.
// Input: Graph and a source vertex src
// Output: Shortest distance to all vertices from src.
// If there is a negative weight cycle, then shortest distances are not calculated, negative weight cycle is reported.
// -> 1) This step initializes distances from the source to all vertices as infinite and distance to the source itself as 0.
// ---> Create an array dist[] of size |V| with all values as infinite except dist[src] where src is source vertex.
// -> 2) This step calculates shortest distances. Do following |V|-1 times where |V| is the number of vertices in given graph.
// ---> a) Do following for each edge u-v
// -----> If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then update dist[v]
// -------> dist[v] = dist[u] + weight of edge uv
// -> 3) This step reports if there is a negative weight cycle in graph. Do following for each edge u-v
// ---> If dist[v] > dist[u] + weight of edge uv, then “Graph contains negative weight cycle”

// The idea of step 3 is, step 2 guarantees the shortest distances if the graph doesn’t contain a negative weight cycle.
// If we iterate through all edges one more time and get a shorter path for any vertex, then there is a negative weight cycle. (AUTOMATIC CYCLE DETECTION)

// How does this work?
// -> Like other Dynamic Programming Problems, the algorithm calculates shortest paths in a bottom-up manner.
// -> It first calculates the shortest distances which have at-most one edge in the path.
// -> Then, it calculates the shortest paths with at-most 2 edges, and so on.
// -> After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the shortest paths with at most i edges are calculated.
// -> There can be maximum |V|–1 edges in any simple path, that is why the outer loop runs |v|–1 times.
// -> The idea is, assuming that there is no negative weight cycle,
// -> if we have calculated shortest paths with at most i edges,
// -> then an iteration over all edges guarantees to give shortest path with at-most (i+1) edges.
// Proof:
// -> Correctness if G(V, E) has no negative weight cycles, then Bellman-Ford terminate with d[v] = S(s,v) for all v is an element of V.
// -> Proof approach: Consider any v in V, by monotonicity and correctness (d[v]>=S(s,v)) only need to show that d[v]=S(s,v) at the same time.
// -> Let: Path p = v0->v1->v2-> ... ->vk, be a shortest path from s to v with the minimum number edges.
// ---> So p is a simple path (no repeating vertices)
// ---> S(s, vi) = S(s, vi-1) + w(vi-1, vi) (by optimal substructure)
// ---> d[V0] = 0 = S(s, v0)
// -> Assume by induction that d[vj] = S(s, vj) after j rounds for j<i.
// -> Before last round: After i-1 rounds d[vi-1] = S(s, vi-1)
// -> During round i: relax (vi-1, vi) ->  so d[vi] = S(s, vi) (by correctness lemma)
// -> After k rounds, we have the correct answer for vk. k<=|V|-1 because p is simple.
// Corollary (contrapositive): If the Bellman Ford for fails to converge after |V|-1 round, then there must be a negative weight cycle.

// Notes:
// -> 1) Negative weights are found in various applications of graphs.
// For example, instead of paying cost for a path, we may get some advantage if we follow the path.
// -> 2) Bellman-Ford works better (better than Dijkstra’s) for distributed systems (for example in a network).
// Unlike Dijkstra’s where we need to find the minimum value of all vertices, in Bellman-Ford, edges are considered one by one.
// -> 3) Bellman-Ford does not work with undirected graph with negative edges as it will declared as negative cycle.

// Exercise:
// -> 1) The standard Bellman-Ford algorithm reports the shortest path only if there are no negative weight cycles.
// Modify it so that it reports minimum distances even if there is a negative weight cycle.
// -> 2) Can we use Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest paths
// for graphs with negative weights – one idea can be, calculate the minimum weight value,
// add a positive value (equal to absolute value of minimum weight value)
// to all weights and run the Dijkstra’s algorithm for the modified graph. Will this algorithm work?


// Other discussions:
// The Bellman–Ford algorithm finds shortest paths from a starting node to all nodes of the graph.
// The algorithm can process all kinds of graphs, provided that the graph does not contain a cycle with negative length.
// If the graph contains a negative cycle, the algorithm can detect this.

// The algorithm keeps track of distances from the starting node to all nodes of the graph.
// Initially, the distance to the starting node is 0 and the distance to all other nodes in infinite.
// The algorithm reduces the distances by finding edges that shorten the paths until it is not possible to reduce any distance.

// Other analysis:
// The time complexity of the algorithm is O(nm), because the algorithm consists of n-1 rounds and iterates through all m edges during a round.
// If there are no negative cycles in the graph, all distances are final after n=1 rounds, because each shortest path can contain at most n-1 edges.
// In practice, the final distances can usually be found faster than in n-1 rounds.
// Thus, a possible way to make the algorithm more efficient is to stop the algorithm if no distance can be reduced during a round.
// Note: In the implementation above, relax function uses a map to store weights which will result to have a logarithmic term in the running time instead.

// Other improvements:
// The SPFA algorithm ("Shortest Path Faster Algorithm") is a variant of the Bellman–Ford algorithm,
// that is often more efficient than the original algorithm.
// -> The algorithm maintains a queue of nodes that might be used for reducing the distances.
// -> First, the algorithm adds the starting node x to the queue.
// -> Then, the algorithm always processes the first node in the queue, and when an edge a->b reduces a distance, node b is added to the queue.
// Note: This is implemented above.

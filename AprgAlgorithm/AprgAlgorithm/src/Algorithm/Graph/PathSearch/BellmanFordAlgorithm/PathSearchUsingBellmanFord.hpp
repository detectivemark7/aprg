// Algorithm in short terms: Relax all nodes.


// Negative weights failed attempts:
// -> Dijkstra does not work on negative edge weights
// -> Reweighting (adding a constant to make all weights positive) does not work either.

// Proposition: A SPT (shortest path tree) exists iff no negative cycles.
// Proposition: A LPT (longest path tree) exists iff no positive cycles.

// Bellman Ford algorithm: Works on negative weights
// Process:
// "s" is the starting vertex
// 1) Initialize distTo[s]=0 and distTo[v]=infinity for all other vertices
// 2) Repeat V times: Relax each edge.

// Proposition: Dynamic programming algorithm computes SPT in any edge weight digraph with no negative cycles in time proportional to E*V
// Proof idea: After pass i, it found the shortest path containing at most i edges.

// Observation: If distTo[v] does not change during pass i, no need to relax any edge pointing from v in pass i+1
// -> Use a queue! Maintain a queue of vertices whose distTo are changed.

// Overall effect:
// -> running time is still proportional to E*V in worst case.
// -> But much faster than that in practice.

// Observation: If there is a negative cycle, Bellman-Ford gets stuck in a loop, updating distTo and edgeTo entries in the cycle.
// Proposition: If any vertex V is updated in phase V there exists a negative cycle (and can be traced back edgeTo[v] entries to find it)
// We can just check if there are any cycles when relax happened V times. This is implemented above.



// Other discussions:
// The Bellman–Ford algorithm finds shortest paths from a starting node to all nodes of the graph.
// The algorithm can process all kinds of graphs, provided that the graph does not contain a cycle with negative length.
// If the graph contains a negative cycle, the algorithm can detect this.

// The algorithm keeps track of distances from the starting node to all nodes of the graph.
// Initially, the distance to the starting node is 0 and the distance to all other nodes in infinite.
// The algorithm reduces the distances by finding edges that shorten the paths until it is not possible to reduce any distance.

// Other analysis:
// The time complexity of the algorithm is O(nm), because the algorithm consists of n-1 rounds and iterates through all m edges during a round.
// If there are no negative cycles in the graph, all distances are final after n=1 rounds, because each shortest path can contain at most n-1 edges.
// In practice, the final distances can usually be found faster than in n-1 rounds.
// Thus, a possible way to make the algorithm more efficient is to stop the algorithm if no distance can be reduced during a round.
// Note: In the implementation above, relax function uses a map to store weights which will result to have a logarithmic term in the running time instead.

// Other improvements:
// The SPFA algorithm ("Shortest Path Faster Algorithm") is a variant of the Bellman–Ford algorithm,
// that is often more efficient than the original algorithm.
// -> The algorithm maintains a queue of nodes that might be used for reducing the distances.
// -> First, the algorithm adds the starting node x to the queue.
// -> Then, the algorithm always processes the first node in the queue, and when an edge a->b reduces a distance, node b is added to the queue.
// Note: This is implemented above.

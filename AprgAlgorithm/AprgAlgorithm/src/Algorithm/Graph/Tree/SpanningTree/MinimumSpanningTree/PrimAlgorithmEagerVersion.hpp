// Algorithm in short terms: Add nearest vertices in the tree.
// Since its eager, nearest vertices are checked every time a new one is added on the tree.

// Running time:
// depends on Indexed-PQ implementation: Total = V inserts + V deletemins + E decrease-keys
// array: insert(1), delete-min(V), decrease-key(1) -> total = V^2
// binary heap: insert(log V), delete-min(log V), decrease-key(log V) -> total = E log V
// d-way heap: insert(d logd V)), delete-min(d logd V), decrease-key(d logd V) -> total = E log(E/V) V
// Fibonacci heap: insert(1*), delete-min(log V*), decrease-key(1*) -> total = E + V log V
// * means amortized
// Bottom line:
// -> Array implementation optimal for dense graphs
// -> Binary heap is faster for sparse graphs
// -> 4 way heap is worth the trouble in performance-critical situations
// -> Fibonacci heap is best in theory, but too complicated to implement (not worth it in practice)
// NOTE: decrease-keys mean these steps:
// -> Get the index of v in heap array
// -> Get the node and update its key value
// -> Travel up while the complete tree is not hepified (swim).
// -> THIS IS NOT IMPLEMENTED ABOVE
// ---> Updates to weight should be only decrease updates and decrease-key operation should be used

// Other discussions:
// Difference between eager and lazy?
// -> Eager only adds (vertex) to search when it has better weight

// The time complexity of Prim’s algorithm is O(n + mlogm) that equals the time complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm.
// Note: 'n' is nodes and 'm' is edges. In practice, Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms are both efficient, and the choice
// of the algorithm is a matter of taste. Still, most competitive programmers use Kruskal’s algorithm.

// We have discussed Kruskal’s algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree.
// Like Kruskal’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm is also a Greedy algorithm.
// It starts with an empty spanning tree.
// The idea is to maintain two sets of vertices.
// The first set contains the vertices already included in the MST, the other set contains the vertices not yet
// included. At every step, it considers all the edges that connect the two sets, and picks the minimum weight edge from
// these edges. After picking the edge, it moves the other endpoint of the edge to the set containing MST. A group of
// edges that connects two set of vertices in a graph is called cut in graph theory. So, at every step of Prim’s
// algorithm, we find a cut (of two sets, one contains the vertices already included in MST and other contains rest of
// the vertices), pick the minimum weight edge from the cut and include this vertex to MST Set (the set that contains
// already included vertices).

// How does Prim’s Algorithm Work?
// The idea behind Prim’s algorithm is simple, a spanning tree means all vertices must be connected.
// So the two disjoint subsets (discussed above) of vertices must be connected to make a Spanning Tree.
// And they must be connected with the minimum weight edge to make it a Minimum Spanning Tree.

// Algorithm
// -> 1) Create a set mstSet that keeps track of vertices already included in MST.
// -> 2) Assign a key value to all vertices in the input graph.
// ---> Initialize all key values as INFINITE. Assign key value as 0 for the first vertex so that it is picked first.
// -> 3) While mstSet doesn’t include all vertices
// ---> 3.a) Pick a vertex u which is not there in mstSet and has minimum key value.
// ---> 3.b) Include u to mstSet.
// ---> 3.c) Update key value of all adjacent vertices of u.
// -----> To update the key values, iterate through all adjacent vertices.
// -----> For every adjacent vertex v, if weight of edge u-v is less than the previous key value of v, update the key
// value as weight of u-v
// -> The idea of using key values is to pick the minimum weight edge from cut.
// -> The key values are used only for vertices which are not yet included in MST,
// -> the key value for these vertices indicate the minimum weight edges connecting them to the set of vertices included
// in MST.

// Time Complexity of the above program is O(V^2).
// If the input graph is represented using adjacency list,
// then the time complexity of Prim’s algorithm can be reduced to O(E log V) with the help of binary heap.
// NOTE: This is roughly the same as Kruskal algorithm.

Tradeoffs:

Linked list implementation:
-> Every operation takes constant time in the worst case.
-> Uses extra time and space to deal with the links (reallocation and deallocation)

Resizing array implementation:
-> Every operation takes constant amortized time.
-> Different space management. (No pointers, sometimes this might even take less space compared to linked list).


Stack applications:
-> Parsing in a compiler
-> Java virtual machine
-> Undo in a word processor
-> Back button in a web browser
-> PostScript language for printers
-> Implementing function calls in a compiler

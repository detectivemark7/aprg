Substring search problem
-> Goal: Find a pattern of length M in a test of length N.
---> Example:
---> Pattern: NEEDLE
---> INAHAYSTACKNEEDLEINA 

Applications:
-> Computer forensics: Search memory or disks for signatures
---> e. g. all URLs or RSA keys that the user has entered
-> Identify patterns indicative of spam
-> Electronic surveillance
-> Screen scraping: Extract relevant data from web page.
---> Find string delimited by <b> and </b>.

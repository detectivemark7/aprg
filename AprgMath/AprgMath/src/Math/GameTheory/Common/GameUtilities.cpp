    // -> There are two players who move alternately.
    // -> The game consists of states, and the possible moves in a state do not depend on whose turn it is.
    // -> The game ends when a player cannot make a move.
    // -> The game surely ends sooner or later.
    // -> The players have complete information about the states and allowed moves, and there is no randomness in the game.
    // The idea is to calculate for each game state a Grundy number that corresponds o the number of sticks in a nim heap.
    // When we know the Grundy numbers of all states, we can play the game like the nim game.

    // The Grundy number of a game state is mex({g1, g2,..., gn}),
    // where g1, g2,..., gn are the Grundy numbers of the states to which we can move,
    // and the mex function gives the SMALLEST NONNEGATIVE number that is NOT in the SET.

    // The Grundy number of a state corresponds to the number of sticks in a nim heap.
    // If the Grundy number is 0, we can only move to states whose Grundy numbers are positive,
    // and if the Grundy number is x>0, we can move to states whose Grundy numbers include all numbers 0,1,...,x-1.

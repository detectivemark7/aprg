    // | | |o| |o|    Positions: {3, 5}    Representation: | | |o|_|o|    | | |o|o|

    // Solution:
    // In this scenario, we can assume that k balls are initially placed in boxes and there is an empty box between each two adjacent boxes.
    // The remaining task is to choose the positions for the remaining empty boxes.

    // To simplify this problem, adjacent empty boxes can be removed on each combination.
    // When empty boxes are removed, this can be reduced to the problem on scenario 1.
    // Thus we need to figure out the new number of boxes and new number of balls

    // Question is how many empty boxes can be removed?
    // If there are 2 balls, empty boxes to remove is 1.
    // If there are 3 balls, empty boxes to remove is 2.
    // If there are 4 balls, empty boxes to remove is 3.
    // So the empty boxes to remove is k-1.
    // Hence, the new number of boxes = old number of boxes - empty boxes to remove = n-(k-1) = n-k+1

    // This can be simplified further because removing boxes might result to number of spaces to be less that number of balls.
    // So we can switch the spaces with the balls and vice versa
    // Hence, the new number of balls = number of spaces = new number of boxes - old number of balls = n-k+1 - k = n-2k+1

    // There are two formulas for the solution on this case:
    // Using number of balls: The formula is combinations of n-k+1 taken k
    // Using number of spaces: The formula is combinations of n-k+1 taken n-2k+1

    // This proof uses André's reflection method, which was originally used in connection with Bertrand's ballot theorem.
    // The reflection principle has been widely attributed to Désiré André,
    // but his method did not actually use reflections and the reflection method is a variation due to Aebly and Mirimanoff.

    // We count the number of paths which start and end on the diagonal of a n×n grid.
    // All such paths have n-right steps (lets assign it to left parentheses) and n-up steps (lets assign it to right parentheses).
    // Since we can choose which of the 2*n steps are up or right, there are in total (2*n, n) monotonic paths of this type.
    // A bad path crosses the main diagonal and touches the next higher (fatal) diagonal ('F' in the illustration).

    // Illustration of nxn grid :
    // | | | |F|x|
    // | | |F|x| |
    // | |F|x| | |
    // |F|x| | | |
    // |x| | | | |

    // The part of the path after the fatal touch is flipped about the fatal diagonal.
    // This SWAPS all the right steps to up steps and vice versa.
    // In the section of the path that is not reflected, there is one more up step than right steps,
    // so therefore the remaining section of the bad path has one more right step than up steps.
    // When this portion of the path is reflected, it will have one more up step than right steps.

    // Since there are still 2n steps, there are now be n+1 up steps (right parentheses) and n−1 right steps (left parentheses).
    // So, instead of reaching (n, n), all bad paths after reflection end at (n−1, n+1).
    // Because every monotonic path in the (n−1) × (n+1) grid meets the fatal diagonal,
    // and because the reflection process is reversible,
    // the reflection is therefore a bijection between bad paths in the original grid and monotonic paths in the new grid.

    // After reflection:
    // The number of right parentheses=n+1 and the number of left parentheses=n-1.
    // The number of bad paths is therefore:
    // (n+1+n-1, n+1) = (2*n, n-1) = (2*n, n+1)

    // This formula is correct because its reduces to boxes and balls formula.

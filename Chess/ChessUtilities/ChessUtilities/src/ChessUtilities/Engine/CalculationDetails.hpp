// Ply explanation:
// Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ply_(game_theory)
// For example, in standard chess terminology, one move consists of a turn by each player; therefore a ply in chess is a
// half-move. Thus, after 20 moves in a chess game, 40 plies have been completedâ€”20 by white and 20 by black.

// PV means "Principal variation"
// Source: https://www.chessprogramming.org/Principal_Variation
// The Principal variation (PV) is a sequence of moves that programs consider best and therefore expect to be played.
// All the nodes included by the PV are PV-nodes.
// Inside an iterative deepening framework, it is the most important move ordering consideration to play the PV
// collected during the current iteration, as the very first left moves of the next iteration

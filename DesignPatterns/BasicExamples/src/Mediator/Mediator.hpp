// Mediator discussion:

// ONE LINE NOTE:
// -> MEDIATE communications between different colleagues to decouple, simplify, abstract, centralize the way of communication.

// Intent:
// Mediator pattern has behavioral purpose and applies on objects.
// The pattern defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
// It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each
// other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.

// When to use (applicability):
// -> a set of objects communicate in well-defined but complex ways
// -> reusing an object is difficult because it refers to and communicates with many other objects
// -> a behavior that's distributed between several classes should be customizable without a lot of subclassing

// Consequences:
// -> It limits subclassing.
// ---> A mediator localizes behavior that otherwise would be distributed among several objects.
// ---> Changing this behavior requires subclassing Mediator only; Colleague classes can be reused as is.
// -> It decouples colleagues.
// ---> A mediator promotes loose coupling between colleagues.
// ---> You can vary and reuse Colleague and Mediator classes independently.
// -> It simplifies object protocols.
// ---> A mediator replaces many-to-many interactions with one-to-many interactions between the mediator and its colleagues.
// ---> One-to-many relationships are easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
// -> It abstracts how objects cooperate.
// ---> Making mediation an independent concept and encapsulating in an object lets you focus on how objects interact apart from their individual behavior.
// -----> This can help clarify how objects interact in a system.
// -> It centralizes control.
// ---> The Mediator pattern trade complexity of interaction for complexity in the mediator.
// ---> Because a mediator encapsulates protocols it can become more complex than any individual colleague.
// ---> This can make the mediator itself a monolith that's hard to maintain.

// Implementation:
// -> Omitting the abstract Mediator class
// ---> There's no need to define an abstract Mediator class when colleagues work with only one mediator.
// ---> The abstract coupling the Meditator class provide lets colleagues work with different Mediator subclasses and vice versa.
// -> Colleague-Mediator communication
// ---> Colleagues have to communicate with their mediator when an event of interest occurs.
// -----> One approach is to implment the Mediator as an Observer using the [Observer] pattern
// -------> Colleague classes act as Subjects, sending notifications to the mediator whenever they change state.
// -------> The mediator responds by propagating the effect of the change to other colleagues.
// ---> Another approach defines a specialized notification interface in Mediator that lets colleagues be more direct in their communication.
// -----> Smalltalk/V for Windows uses a form of delegation in the communication.

// Related Patterns
// -> [Facade] differs from Mediator in that it abstracts a subsystem of objects to provide a more convenient interface.
// ---> Its protocol is unidirectional: Facade objects make request of the subsystem classes but not vice versa.
// ---> In concrast, Mediator enables cooperative behavior that colleague objects don't or can't provide, and the protocol is multidirectional.
// -> Colleagues can communicate with the mediator using the [Observer] pattern.

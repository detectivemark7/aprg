// Command discussion:

// ONE LINE NOTE:
// -> Encapsulate a REQUEST into a "command object" that can INVOKE different operations (such execute/undo)

// Intent:
// Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object,
// thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and supports undoable operations.
// The pattern has a behavioral purpose and deals with relationships between objects.

// When to use (applicability):
// -> want to parameterize objects by an action to perform
// -> want to specify, queue, and execute requests at different times
// -> support undo
// -> support logging changes so that they can be reapplied in case of a system crash
// -> structure a system around high-level operations built on primitives operations

// Consequences:
// -> The command decouples the object that invokes the operation from the one that knows how to perform it.
// -> The commands are first-class objects. They can be manipulated and extended like any other object.
// -> You can assemble command into a composite command (using [Composite] pattern).
// -> Its easy to add new Commands, because you don't have to change existing classes.

// Implementation:
// -> How intelligent should a command be?
// ---> At one extreme it merely defines a binding between a receiver and the actions that carry out the request.
// ---> At the other extreme it implements everything itself without delegating to a receiver at all.
// -----> This is applicable when commands are independent, when no suitable receiver exists or when command knows its receiver implicitly.
// -> Supporting undo and redo
// ---> Commands can support undo and redo capabilities if they can provide a way to reverse their execution.
// ---> A concrete command class might need to store additional state to do so. The state can include:
// -----> The receiver object, which actually carries out operations in response to the request.
// -----> The arguments to the operation performed on the receiver.
// -----> Any original values in the receiver that can change as a result of handling the request.
// ---> For multiple level of undo and redo, the application needs a history list of commands that have been executed.
// -----> Some commands might need to save additional information.
// -------> For example the DeleteCommand might need to copy original information to restore that information.
// -> Avoiding error accumulation in the undo process
// ---> Hysteresis can be a problem in enxureing a reliable, semantics-preserving undo/redo mechanism.
// ---> It may be necessary therefore to store more information in the command to ensure that objects are restored to their original state.
// -----> The [Memento] pattern can be applied to give the command access to this information without exposing the internals of objects.
// -> Using C++ templates
// ---> For commands that arent undoable and dont require arguments, we can use C++ templates to avoid creating additional subclasses.

// Related Patterns
// -> A [Composite] can be used to implement MacroCommands (commands that contain multiple commands).
// -> A [Memento] can keep the state the command requires to undo its effect.
// -> A command that must be copied before being place on the history list acts as a [Prototype].

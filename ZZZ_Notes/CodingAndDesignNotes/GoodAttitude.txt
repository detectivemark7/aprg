This is taken from the book: [Antipatterns - Refactoring Software, Architectures, and Projects in Crisis]

-> Root causes are mistakes in software development that result in failed projects, cost overruns, schedule slips, and unfulfilled business needs.
-> Avoid this sins of a programmer/developer:
---> (1) Haste
-----> Hasty decisions lead to compromises in software quality. 
---> (2) Apathy
-----> Apathy is not caring about solving known problems. 
---> (3) Narrow−Mindedness
-----> Narrow−mindedness is the refusal to practice solutions that are otherwise widely known to be effective.
---> (4) Sloth
-----> Sloth is the “healthy sign” of a lazy developer or manager, who makes poor decisions based upon an “easy answer”.
---> (5) Avarice
-----> Greed can take many forms, but it leads to inappropriate software development decisions.
-----> Architectural avarice means the modeling of excessive details, which results in excessive complexity due to insufficient abstraction.
---> (6) Ignorance
-----> Ignorance is intellectual sloth. 
-----> It’s the result of failing to seek understanding. 
---> (7) Pride
-----> The sin of pride is the not−invented−here syndrome.
-----> Often, developers unnecessarily invent new designs when knowledge from preexisting systems, products, and standards are readily applied through architecture mining.



Taken from "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos"

-> "Stand up straight with your shoulders back."
---> This is to open yourself up to the world.  You're not in a defensive crouch of a prey animal, and that is the circuitry that's governing posture.
---> When communicating yourself via presentation or just day to day conversations. Be sure you are not in a defensive stance. Be alert but not necessarily combative.
-> "Treat yourself like you are someone you are responsible for helping." or "Treat yourself like you are someone you care about."
---> 
-> "Make friends with people who want the best for you."
-> "Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today."
-> "Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them."
-> "Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world."
-> "Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)."
-> "Tell the truth — or, at least, don’t lie."
-> "Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t."
-> "Be precise in your speech."
-> "Do not bother children when they are skate-boarding."
-> "Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street."

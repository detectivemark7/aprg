// APPROACH:
// 1) Dynamic Programming by Iterative method:
// -> Each "cell" has a value of "needed points to make path"
// -> Reverse traversal (from bottom-right to top-left)
// -> Traversal uses previous values to compute for a new value
// -> The computation of the "needed points to make path" of each cell is:
// ---> Get the "needed points from neighbors"
// -----> Get value of bottom neighbor and right neighbor
// -----> Return minimum value of the two neighbors and subtract the value of this cell
// ---> Get maximum of "minimum points to move (which is 1)" and "needed points from neighbors"
// -> Optimization:
// ---> Last row has no bottom neighbors and last column has no right neighbors so it will be easier to compute for one
// neighbor

// Minimum Initial Points to Reach Destination

// Given a grid with each cell consisting of positive, negative or no points i.e, zero points.
// We can move across a cell only if we have positive points ( > 0 ).
// Whenever we pass through a cell, points in that cell are added to our overall points.
// We need to find minimum initial points to reach cell (m-1, n-1) from (0, 0).

// Constraints:
// -> From a cell (i, j) we can move to (i+1, j) or (i, j+1).
// -> We cannot move from (i, j) if your overall points at (i, j) is <= 0.
// -> We have to reach at (n-1, m-1) with minimum positive points i.e., > 0.

// Example:

// Input: points[m][n] = { {-2, -3,   3},
//                         {-5, -10,  1},
//                         {10,  30, -5} };
// -> Output: 7
// -> Explanation:
// -> 7 is the minimum value to reach destination with positive throughout the path.
// -> Below is the path:
// ---> (0,0) -> (0,1) -> (0,2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2)

// We start from (0, 0) with 7, we reach(0, 1) with 5, (0, 2) with 2, (1, 2) with 5, (2, 2)
// with and finally we have 1 point (we needed greater than 0 points at the end).

// Approach:
// At the first look, this problem looks similar Max/Min Cost Path, but maximum overall points gained will not guarantee
// the minimum initial points. Also, it is compulsory in the current problem that the points never drops to zero or
// below. For instance, Suppose following two paths exists from source to destination cell.

// We can solve this problem through bottom-up table filling dynamic programing technique.
// -> To begin with, we should maintain a 2D array dp of the same size as the grid, where dp[i][j] represents the
// minimum points that guarantees the continuation of the journey to destination before entering the cell (i, j). It’s
// but obvious that dp[0][0] is our final solution. Hence, for this problem, we need to fill the table from the bottom
// right corner to left top.
// -> Now, let us decide minimum points needed to leave cell (i, j) (remember we are moving from bottom to up). There
// are only two paths to choose: (i+1, j) and (i, j+1). Of course we will choose the cell that the player can finish the
// rest of his journey with a smaller initial points. Therefore we have: min_Points_on_exit = min(dp[i+1][j],
// dp[i][j+1])

// Now we know how to compute min_Points_on_exit, but we need to fill the table dp[][] to get the solution in dp[0][0].

// How to compute dp[i][j]?
// -> The value of dp[i][j] can be written as below.

// dp[i][j] = max(min_Points_on_exit – points[i][j], 1)

// Let us see how above expression covers all cases.
// -> If points[i][j] == 0, then nothing is gained in this cell;
// the player can leave the cell with the same points as he enters the room with, i.e. dp[i][j] = min_Points_on_exit.
// -> If points[i][j] < 0, then the player must have points greater than min_Points_on_exit before entering (i, j)
// in order to compensate for the points lost in this cell.
// The minimum amount of compensation is " – points[i][j] ", so we have dp[i][j] = min_Points_on_exit – points[i][j].
// -> If points[i][j] > 0, then the player could enter (i, j) with points as little as min_Points_on_exit –
// points[i][j]. Since he could gain “points[i][j]” points in this cell. However, the value of min_Points_on_exit –
// points[i][j] might drop to 0 or below in this situation. When this happens, we must clip the value to 1 in order to
// make sure dp[i][j] stays positive:
// -> dp[i][j] = max(min_Points_on_exit – points[i][j], 1).

// Finally return dp[0][0] which is our answer.

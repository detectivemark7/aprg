// As an example, consider the following problem:
// There is a company that has n employees, and we know for each employee their arrival and leaving times on a certain day.

// Our task is to calculate the maximum number of employees that were in the office at the same time.
// The problem can be solved by modeling the situation so that each employee
// is assigned two events that correspond to their arrival and leaving times.
// After sorting the events, we go through them and keep track of the number of people in the office.

// The running time of the algorithm is O(nlogn), because sorting the events takes O(nlogn) time
// and the rest of the algorithm takes O(n) time.

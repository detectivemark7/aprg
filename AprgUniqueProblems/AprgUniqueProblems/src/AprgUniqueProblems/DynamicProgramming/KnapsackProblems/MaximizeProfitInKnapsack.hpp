// APPROACH:
// 1) Naive Recursion /  Dynamic Programming by Memoization:
// -> Each "weight" and "item index" has a "profit" possible
// -> Start recursion at the "maximum weight" and item index as 0.
// -> Each "profit" (with inputs "weight" and "item index") can be computed by:
// ---> If "weight" >= weight at "item index":
// -----> Get profit if item is USED:
// -------> Recursively call "weight" - weight at "item index" and increment to next "item index"
// -----> Get profit if item is SKIPPED:
// -------> Recursively call "weight" and increment to next "item index"
// -----> Return max of the two profits
// ---> Else ("weight" < weight at "item index"):
// -----> Return zero profit

// 2) Dynamic Programming by Tabular method:
// -> Create an matrix or profits with size of columns as "maximum weight" and size of rows as number of input values
// -> Thus each "weight" and "item index" has a profit.
// -> Forward traversal for weight and reverse traversal for item index
// -> Traversal uses previous values to compute for a new value
// -> The computation of each profit (each cell in the matrix) is:
// ---> Get the current itemWeight and itemProfit.
// ---> If weight >= itemWeight
// -----> Get profit if item is USED:
// -------> Get entry at "weight" - itemWeight and "incremented item index"
// -------> Add current itemProfit
// -----> Get profit if item is SKIPPED:
// -------> Get entry at "weight" and "incremented item index"
// -----> Return the maximum profit of the two profits
// ---> Else ("weight" < itemWeight):
// -----> Return zero profit

// 3) Dynamic Programming by Tabular method and space efficient:
// -> Create an array of profits with size as "maximum weight"
// -> Thus each "weight" has a profit.
// -> Reverse traversal (from right to left)
// ---> Reverse traversal so that the changed values wont be changed again in one iteration
// -> Traversal uses previous values to compute for a new value
// -> Traverse all input values (this ensures that input values are only used once):
// ---> Get the current itemWeight and itemProfit.
// ---> Traverse all the weights (from "maximum weight" to zero):
// ---> If weight >= itemWeight
// -----> Get current profit:
// -------> Get entry at "weight"
// -----> Get profit if item is USED:
// -------> Get entry at "weight" - itemWeight
// -------> Add current itemProfit
// -----> Return the maximum profit of the two profits




// Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
// In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively.
// Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,
// find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
// You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or don’t pick it (0-1 property).

// Approach: A simple solution is to consider all subsets of items and calculate the total weight and value of all subsets.
// Consider the only subsets whose total weight is smaller than W. From all such subsets, pick the maximum value subset.
// Optimal Sub-structure: To consider all subsets of items, there can be two cases for every item.
// -> Case 1: The item is included in the optimal subset.
// -> Case 2: The item is not included in the optimal set.

// Therefore, the maximum value that can be obtained from ‘n’ items is the max of the following two values.
// -> Maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W weight (excluding nth item).
// -> Value of nth item plus maximum value obtained by n-1 items and W minus the weight of the nth item (including nth item).

// If the weight of ‘nth’ item is greater than ‘W’, then the nth item cannot be included and Case 1 is the only possibility.

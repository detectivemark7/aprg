// APPROACH:
// 1) Dynamic Programming by Iterative method:
// -> Get the maximum possible partial sum and create an array of booleans ("isPartialSumPossible") with that size
// -> Thus each "partial sum" has a boolean if its possible.
// -> Set "partial sum" = 0 as true (0 is possible partial sum)
// -> Reverse traversal (from right to left)
// ---> Reverse traversal so that the changed values wont be changed again in one iteration
// -> Traversal uses previous values (because it was for a previous item) to compute for a new value
// -> Traverse all input values (this ensures that input values are only used once):
// ---> Traverse all the partial sums (from maximum sum to zero):
// -----> This "partial sum" is possible if "partial sum" >= "input value" and if "partial sum"-"input value" is
// possible

// 2) Dynamic Programming by Iterative method (by setting future values):
// -> Get the maximum possible partial sum and create an array of booleans ("isPartialSumPossible") with that size
// -> Thus each "partial sum" has a boolean if its possible.
// -> Set "partial sum" = 0 as true (0 is possible partial sum)
// -> Reverse traversal (from right to left)
// ---> Reverse traversal so that the changed values wont be changed again in one iteration
// -> Traversal uses previous values (because it was for a previous item) to compute for a new value
// -> Traverse all input values (this ensures that input values are only used once):
// ---> Traverse all the partial sums (from maximum sum to zero):
// -----> If current "partial sum" is possible:
// -------> A future "partial sum" is possible if its equal to the current "partial sum" plus an "input value".

// The term knapsack refers to problems where a set of objects is given, and subsets with some properties have to be
// found. Knapsack problems can often be solved using dynamic programming.

// In this section, we focus on the following problem:
// Given a list of weights [w1,w2,...,wn], determine all sums that can be constructed using the weights.

// Recurrence formulation:
// -> Let possible(x,k) = true if we can construct a sum x using the first k weights, and otherwise possible(x,k) =
// false
// -> possible(x,k) = possible(x-weight of k,k-1) union possible(x,k-1)

// Other discussions:
// Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in
// the knapsack. In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights
// associated with n items respectively. Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, find out the
// maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. You cannot
// break an item, either pick the complete item or don’t pick it (0-1 property).

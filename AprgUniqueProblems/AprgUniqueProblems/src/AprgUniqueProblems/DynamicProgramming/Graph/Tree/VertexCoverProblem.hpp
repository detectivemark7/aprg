// APPROACH:
// 1) Naive Recursion / Dynamic Programming by Memoization:
// -> Each "node/vertex" has a "minimum count" and this can be computed by:
// ---> Get count when vertex is included (recursively call the count of children and add 1 for this vertex)
// ---> Get count when vertex is not included (recursively call the count of grandChildren and add 1 for this each
// children)
// ---> Return the minimum of the two counts

// Vertex Cover Problem

// A vertex cover of an undirected graph is a subset of its vertices such that
// for every edge (u, v) of the graph, either ‘u’ or ‘v’ is in vertex cover.
// Although the name is Vertex Cover, the set covers all edges of the given graph.
// The problem to find minimum size vertex cover of a graph is NP complete.
// But it can be solved in polynomial time for trees.
// In this post a solution for Binary Tree is discussed.
// The same solution can be extended for n-ary trees.

// For example, consider the following binary tree. The smallest vertex cover is {20, 50, 30} and size of the vertex
// cover is 3.

// The idea is to consider following two possibilities for root and recursively for all nodes down the root.
// 1) Root is part of vertex cover:
// -> In this case root covers all children edges.
// -> We recursively calculate size of vertex covers for left and right subtrees and add 1 to the result (for root).
// 2) Root is not part of vertex cover:
// -> In this case, both children of root must be included in vertex cover to cover all root to children edges.
// -> We recursively calculate size of vertex covers of all grandchildren
// -> and number of children to the result (for two children of root).

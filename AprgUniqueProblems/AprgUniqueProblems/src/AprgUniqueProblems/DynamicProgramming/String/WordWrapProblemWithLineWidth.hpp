// Word Wrap Problem

// Given a sequence of words, and a limit on the number of characters that can be put in one line (line width).
// Put line breaks in the given sequence such that the lines are printed neatly.
// Assume that the length of each word is smaller than the line width.

// The word processors like MS Word do task of placing line breaks.
// The idea is to have balanced lines.
// In other words, not have few lines with lots of extra spaces and some lines with small amount of extra spaces.

// The extra spaces includes spaces put at the end of every line except the last one.
// The problem is to minimize the following total cost.
// Cost of a line = (Number of extra spaces in the line)^3
// Total Cost = Sum of costs for all lines

// For example, consider the following string and line width M = 15
// -> "Geeks for Geeks presents word wrap problem"
// -> Following is the optimized arrangement of words in 3 lines
// ---> Geeks for Geeks
// ---> presents word
// ---> wrap problem
// -> The total extra spaces in line 1, line 2 and line 3 are 0, 2 and 3 respectively.
// -> So optimal value of total cost is 0 + 2*2 + 3*3 = 13

// Please note that the total cost function is not sum of extra spaces, but sum of cubes (or square is also used) of extra spaces.
// The idea behind this cost function is to balance the spaces among lines.
// For example, consider the following two arrangement of same set of words:
// 1) There are 3 lines.
// -> One line has 3 extra spaces and all other lines have 0 extra spaces.
// -> Total extra spaces = 3 + 0 + 0 = 3.
// -> Total cost = 3*3*3 + 0*0*0 + 0*0*0 = 27.
// 2) There are 3 lines.
// -> Each of the 3 lines has one extra space.
// -> Total extra spaces = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
// -> Total cost = 1*1*1 + 1*1*1 + 1*1*1 = 3.
// Total extra spaces are 3 in both scenarios, but second arrangement should be preferred because extra spaces are balanced in all three lines.
// The cost function with cubic sum serves the purpose because the value of total cost in second scenario is less.

// Method 1 (Greedy Solution)
// The greedy solution is to place as many words as possible in the first line.
// Then do the same thing for the second line and so on until all words are placed.
// This solution gives optimal solution for many cases, but doesn’t give optimal solution in all cases.
// For example, consider the following string “aaa bb cc ddddd” and line width as 6.
// Greedy method will produce following output:
// -> aaa bb
// -> cc
// -> ddddd
// Extra spaces in the above 3 lines are 0, 4 and 1 respectively.
// So total cost is 0 + 64 + 1 = 65.
// But the above solution is not the best solution.
// Following arrangement has more balanced spaces.
// Therefore less value of total cost function.
// -> aaa
// -> bb cc
// -> ddddd
// Extra spaces in the above 3 lines are 3, 1 and 1 respectively.
// So total cost is 27 + 1 + 1 = 29.
// Despite being sub-optimal in some cases, the greedy approach is used by many word processors like MS Word and OpenOffice.org Writer.

// Method 2 (Dynamic Programming)
// The following Dynamic approach strictly follows the algorithm given in solution of Cormen book.
// First we compute costs of all possible lines in a 2D table lc[][].
// The value lc[i][j] indicates the cost to put words from i to j in a single line where i and j are indexes of words in the input sequences.
// If a sequence of words from i to j cannot fit in a single line, then lc[i][j] is considered infinite (to avoid it from being a part of the solution).
// Once we have the lc[][] table constructed, we can calculate total cost using following recursive formula.
// In the following formula, C[j] is the optimized total cost for arranging words from 1 to j.


// Word Wrap problem (space optimized solution)

// Given a sequence of words, and a limit on the number of characters that can be put in one line (line width).
// Put line breaks in the given sequence such that the lines are printed neatly.
// Assume that the length of each word is smaller than the line width.
// When line breaks are inserted there is a possibility that extra spaces are present in each line.
// The extra spaces includes spaces put at the end of every line except the last one.
// The problem is to minimize the following total cost.
// Total cost = Sum of cost of all lines, where cost of line is = (Number of extra spaces in the line)^2.

// -> For example, consider the following string and line width M = 15
// ---> “Geeks for Geeks presents word wrap problem”
// ---> Following is the optimized arrangement of words in 3 lines
// -----> Geeks for Geeks
// -----> presents word
// -----> wrap problem
// ---> The total extra spaces in line 1 and line 2 are 0 and 2.
// ---> Space for line 3 is not considered as it is not extra space as described above.
// ---> So optimal value of total cost is 0 + 2*2 = 4.

// Examples:
// -> Input format: Input will consists of array of integers where each array element represents length of each word of string.
// ---> For example, for string S = "Geeks for Geeks", input array will be arr[] = {5, 3, 5}.
// -> Output format: Output consists of a series of integers
// ---> where two consecutive integers represent starting word and ending word of each line.

// -> Input : arr[] = {3, 2, 2, 5}
// ---> Output : 1 1 2 3 4 4
// ---> Line number 1: From word no. 1 to 1
// ---> Line number 2: From word no. 2 to 3
// ---> Line number 3: From word no. 4 to 4

// -> Input : arr[] = {3, 2, 2}
// ---> Output : 1 1 2 2 3 3
// ---> Line number 1: From word no. 1 to 1
// ---> Line number 2: From word no. 2 to 2
// ---> Line number 3: From word no. 3 to 3

// Approach: We have discussed a Dynamic Programming based solution of word wrap problem.
// -> The solution discussed used O(n^2) auxiliary space.
// -> The auxiliary space used can be reduced to O(n).
// -> The idea is to use two 1-D arrays dp[] and ans[],
// -> where dp[i] represents minimum cost of the line in which arr[i] is the first word
// -> and ans[i] represents index of last word present in line in which word arr[i] is the first word.
// -> Let k represents limit on number of characters in each line.
// -> Suppose for any line l the first word in that line is at index i in arr[].
// -> The minimum cost of that line is stored in dp[i].
// -> The last word in that line is at index j in arr[], where j can vary from i to n.
// -> Iterate over all values of j and keep track of number of characters added so far in line l.
// -> If number of characters are less than k then find cost of current line with these number of characters.
// -> Compare this cost with minimum cost find so far for this line in dp[i] and update dp[i] and ans[i] accordingly.
// -> Repeat above procedure for each value of i, 1 <= i <= n.
// -> The starting and ending words of each line will be at index i and index ans[i], where next value of i for line l+1 is ans[i] + 1.

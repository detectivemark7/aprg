    // We are given the prices of k products over n days, and we want to buy each product exactly once.

    // Recursive formulation:
    // -> Let price[x][d] denote the price of product x on day d.
    // -> Then, let total(S,d) denote the minimum total price for buying a subset S of products by day d.
    // ---> total(nullset,d) = 0, because it does not cost anything to buy an empty set,
    // ---> and total({x},0) = price[x][0], because there is one way to buy one product on the first day.
    // -> Using this function, the solution to the problem is total({0...k-1},n-1).
    // -> total(S,d) = min(total(S,d-1), min of (total(S\product,d-1)+price[product][d]) all products)
